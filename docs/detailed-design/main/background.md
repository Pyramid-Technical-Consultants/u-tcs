# background.js

In Electron, the main process is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the application, creating and managing browser windows, and handling system-level events. It runs separately from the renderer process and has access to Node.js APIs, making it suitable for tasks that require higher privileges.

### IPC (Inter-Process Communication)

Electron provides IPC mechanisms to allow communication between the main process and renderer processes. The `ipcMain` module in the main process listens for messages from the renderer process, while the `ipcRenderer` module in the renderer process sends messages to the main process.

## Detailed Design

The `background.js` script initializes the Electron application, creates the main window, sets up the application menu, and manages various IPC handlers to respond to requests from the renderer process. It also initializes major U-TCS sub-systems.

### Modules Used

- `path`: Provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
- `app`, `ipcMain`, `nativeTheme`: Electron modules for application lifecycle, IPC, and theme management.
- `electron-serve`: Serves static files in production.
- `createWindow`, `createMenu`: Helper functions for creating windows and menus.

### Key Functions and Handlers

- **App Initialization**: Creates the main window, sets the initial mode, and loads the appropriate URL based on the environment (production or development).
- **IPC Handlers**: Handles various IPC requests such as login, logout, mode changes, and kit data retrieval.

### Security Considerations

- **Environment Separation**: Differentiate between production and development environments to ensure proper handling of user data and application behavior.
- **Data Verification**: Verify all inputs and outputs to and from IPC handlers to prevent injection attacks.
- **Least Privilege**: Only expose necessary functionalities to the renderer process to minimize the attack surface.

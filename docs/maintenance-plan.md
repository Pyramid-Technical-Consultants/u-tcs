# U-TCS Maintenance Plan

This maintenance plan outlines the procedures and processes for maintaining the United Treatment Control System (U-TCS) after its major releases. It covers software updates, bug fixes, patches, and long-term support strategies.

## Maintenance Objectives

- Ensure the continued functionality and reliability of U-TCS
- Address bugs and security vulnerabilities promptly
- Provide necessary updates to maintain compatibility with evolving technologies
- Implement minor improvements based on user feedback
- Maintain compliance with relevant medical device software standards

## Long-Term Support Strategy

- Maintain support for each major version for at least 2 years from its release date, ideally until the last clinical user upgrades
- Provide security updates and critical bug fixes for supported versions
- Encourage end-users to upgrade to the latest major version
- Provide clear end-of-life dates for each major version if required

## Types of Maintenance

### Corrective Maintenance

Addressing bugs and issues reported by users or identified through monitoring.

### Preventive Maintenance

Regular code reviews, security audits, and performance optimizations to prevent potential issues.

### Perfective Maintenance

Minor improvements and optimizations based on user feedback and technological advancements.

### Adaptive Maintenance

Updates to ensure compatibility with new operating systems, hardware, or regulatory requirements.

## Maintenance Procedures

### Bug Fixes and Patches

1. Bug Report/Issue Identification
   - Through user reports, automated monitoring, or internal testing
   - Log issue in GitHub Issues

2. Triage and Prioritization
   - Assess severity and impact
   - Assign priority level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

3. Investigation and Root Cause Analysis
   - Reproduce the issue
   - Identify the root cause

4. Fix Development
   - Create a `hotfix` branch from `main`
   - Develop and test the fix
   - Conduct code review

5. Validation and Verification
   - Run automated tests
   - Perform manual testing
   - Update relevant documentation

6. Release Preparation
   - Update version number (patch increment)
   - Prepare release notes

7. Approval and Release
   - Obtain approval from Project Manager and QA Lead
   - Merge `hotfix` into `main` and `develop`
   - Tag the release
   - Build and publish the patch

8. Post-Release Monitoring
   - Monitor for any issues related to the patch
   - Gather user feedback

### Minor Updates and Improvements

1. Collect and Review Feedback
   - Gather user suggestions and feature requests
   - Analyze usage data and performance metrics

2. Prioritization
   - Evaluate potential improvements
   - Prioritize based on impact, effort, and strategic alignment

3. Planning and Approval
   - Create detailed plans for approved improvements
   - Obtain approval from Project Manager

4. Implementation
   - Develop improvements on feature branches
   - Conduct code reviews and testing

5. Integration
   - Merge approved features into `develop` branch

6. Release
   - Include in the next major release (as per Release Plan)

### Security Updates

1. Vulnerability Identification
   - Through security audits, automated scans, or external reports

2. Risk Assessment
   - Evaluate the severity and potential impact of the vulnerability

3. Fix Development
   - Create a `hotfix` branch
   - Develop and test the security fix

4. Expedited Review and Testing
   - Conduct thorough security testing
   - Perform code review with focus on security implications

5. Emergency Release
   - Follow expedited release process for critical vulnerabilities
   - For lower severity, include in next scheduled release

6. Disclosure and Communication
   - Prepare security advisory if applicable
   - Communicate with users about the vulnerability and update as necessary

## Documentation Maintenance

- Keep user manuals up-to-date with each release
- Update installation and upgrade guides as necessary

## Third-Party Dependency Management

- Regularly review and update third-party libraries
- Assess security implications of dependency updates
- Test thoroughly when updating critical dependencies

## Compliance and Regulatory Maintenance

- Stay informed about changes in relevant regulations (e.g., medical device software standards)
- Conduct regular compliance audits
- Update software and documentation to maintain compliance

## End-of-Life Procedure

When a major version reaches end-of-life:
1. Notify users at least 12 months in advance
2. Provide clear upgrade paths and assistance
3. Archive the version's source code and documentation
4. Remove download links for the EOL version from official channels

## Maintenance Schedule

- Daily: Monitor for critical issues and user reports
- Weekly: Review and triage non-critical issues
- Monthly: Security vulnerability scans
- Quarterly: Performance review and optimization
- Annually: Possible major version release and long-term planning

## Maintenance Metrics and Reporting

Track and report on:
- Number of bugs fixed
- Average time to resolution
- User satisfaction ratings
- System uptime and performance metrics

# U-TCS Software Validation Plan and Report

## Introduction

This document outlines the validation plan for the United Treatment Control System (U-TCS), an open-source control system for coordinating medical and industrial devices in radiation therapy treatments. The purpose of this validation is to ensure that U-TCS meets end-user needs and performs as intended in its operational environment.

## Scope

This validation plan covers the entire U-TCS software system, including:

- User Management System (UMS)
- Patient Management System (PMS)
- RT Ion Plan System (RIPS)
- Logging Accountability Control System (LACS)
- Main application and user interface
- End-user custom software

## Validation Approach

The validation process will follow these steps:

1. Installation Qualification (IQ)
2. Operational Qualification (OQ)
3. Performance Qualification (PQ)

## Validation Environment

- Hardware: Representative of the target clinical environment
- Software: Latest stable release of U-TCS
- Connected devices: Simulated or real radiation therapy equipment
- Test data: Anonymized patient data and treatment plans or test plans

## Validation Activities

The following test cases are considered the most important to verify the system's correctness and safety. Each test case must have its own Markdown file in the `docs/system-tests` directory. The test case file must contain detailed instructions for executing the test case, and the latest results of the test case. Previous test results are retained in the git history of the file.

### Installation Qualification (IQ)

Objective: Verify that U-TCS is installed correctly in the intended environment.

Test Cases:
1. IQ-1: Verify successful installation on supported operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
2. IQ-2: Confirm all required dependencies are installed and configured correctly
3. IQ-3: Check system requirements are met (e.g., memory, storage, processing power)

### Operational Qualification (OQ)

Objective: Verify that U-TCS operates as designed and all features function correctly.

Test Cases:
1. OQ-1: User Management
   - Create, modify, and delete user accounts
   - Verify access controls and permissions

2. OQ-2: Patient Management
   - Create, update, and retrieve patient records
   - Import and manage DICOM files

3. OQ-3: Treatment Planning
   - Create and modify RT Ion plans
   - Verify plan integrity checks and validation

4. OQ-4: Logging and Accountability
   - Verify comprehensive logging of all system actions
   - Test log encryption and secure storage

5. OQ-5: User Interface
   - Navigate through all screens and menus
   - Verify responsiveness and correct display of information

### Performance Qualification (PQ)

Objective: Verify that U-TCS meets user needs and performs as intended in simulated real-world scenarios.

Test Cases:
1. PQ-1: Complete Treatment Workflow
   - Simulate a full treatment cycle from patient registration to treatment delivery
   - Verify correct coordination with simulated radiation therapy equipment

2. PQ-2: Multi-User Scenario
   - Test concurrent access by multiple users with different roles
   - Verify system performance and data integrity under load

3. PQ-3: Error Handling and Recovery
   - Simulate various error conditions (e.g., network failure, data corruption)
   - Verify system response and recovery procedures

4. PQ-4: Long-Term Operation
   - Run the system continuously for an extended period (e.g., 24 hours)
   - Monitor for stability, memory leaks, and performance degradation

5. PQ-5: Data Migration and Backup
   - Test data migration from previous versions or systems
   - Verify backup and restore procedures

## Acceptance Criteria

- All IQ tests pass successfully
- At least 95% of OQ tests pass successfully, with no critical failures
- All PQ tests pass successfully, demonstrating the system's ability to meet user needs in simulated or real-world scenarios

## Validation Reporting

A comprehensive validation report will be generated, including:

1. Executive Summary
2. Validation Plan Overview
3. Test Results
   - Detailed results for each test case
   - Pass/Fail status and any deviations or observations
4. Traceability Matrix
   - Mapping of user requirements to test cases and results
5. Defect Summary
   - List of any identified issues, their severity, and resolution status
6. Conclusion
   - Overall assessment of system validity
   - Recommendations for release or further actions

## End-User Training

- Provide training to end-users based on validation scenarios
- Document any usability issues identified during validation for inclusion in user training materials

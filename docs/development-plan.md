# U-TCS Software Development Plan (SDP)

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

U-TCS will follow an Agile development methodology, specifically using the Scrum framework. The SDLC will consist of the following phases:

1. Requirements Gathering
2. Design & Development
3. Verification & Validation Testing
4. Deployment
5. Review

These phases will be iterative, with each iteration (sprint) ranging from 2 weeks to several months.

## Processes

### Sprint Planning

- Held at the beginning of each sprint
- Team defines sprint goals and selects items from the product backlog

### Sprint Review

- Held at the end of each sprint
- Team demonstrates completed work to stakeholders

### Sprint Retrospective

- Follows the sprint review
- Team reflects on the sprint and identifies improvements

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Automated build and test processes
- Regular code integration and deployment to staging environments

### Code Reviews

- All code changes require peer review before merging
- Emphasis on code quality, security, and adherence to coding standards

### Documentation

- Ongoing documentation of code, APIs, and user guides
- Regular updates to reflect current system state

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Product Owner

- Manages the product backlog
- Defines and prioritizes features
- Ensures alignment with stakeholder needs

### Scrum Managers

# Security Policy

## Introduction

The U-TCS project prioritizes the security of our users and contributors. We encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities to maintain the integrity and safety of our codebase. This policy outlines the process for reporting security issues and how we handle them.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and support the following versions of U-TCS. Please ensure that your security report applies to one of these supported versions:

| Version       | Supported          |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Latest (main) | Yes                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in the project, we request that you follow the process below to report it responsibly:

1. **Private Disclosure**  
   Please **do not report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues**. Instead, report it privately to the project maintainers by sending an email to <support@ptcusa.com>. Please include the following details in your report:
   
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any suggestions on how to mitigate the issue, if known.

2. **Acknowledgment**  
   We will respond to your report within **3 business days** and provide a timeline for addressing the issue.

3. **Public Disclosure**  
   Once the vulnerability has been addressed and a patch is available, we will publicly disclose the issue through either:
   - A GitHub security advisory.
   - A changelog update with details about the fix.
   
   In certain cases, we may acknowledge the reporting individual(s) or organization, unless requested otherwise.

## Handling Security Issues in GitHub Issues

If you mistakenly submit a security vulnerability via a public GitHub issue:
1. We will immediately hide the issue to prevent public exposure.
2. We will guide you through the appropriate private disclosure process.
3. We will close the public issue once the vulnerability has been resolved privately.

## Security Fixes and Updates

For any valid security issues:
- We will issue patches for the latest supported version(s).
- We will document the vulnerability, the severity, and the fix in the release notes.

For critical vulnerabilities, we will release a hotfix as soon as possible and communicate it clearly through GitHub notifications and release announcements.

## Scope

This policy applies to the following areas:
- Core functionality of U-TCS.
- Any dependencies or integrations maintained by the core team.
- Third-party services or libraries are outside the scope of this policy unless explicitly maintained within the repository.

## Credits and Acknowledgment

We greatly appreciate the efforts of the security community and those who report vulnerabilities responsibly. If you wish to remain anonymous, we will respect your privacy.
